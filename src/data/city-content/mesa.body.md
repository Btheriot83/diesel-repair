Mesa freight runs east–west on US‑60 and feeds onto the 202 loops serving industrial parks from Red Mountain to Santan. Afternoon heat and slow climbs expose weak cooling and reefer electrical faults. We respond curbside with mobile diagnostics, belt and hose swaps, battery and alternator testing, and quick electrical repairs to get you moving without a tow. Routes are planned for safer shoulders near exit clusters and frontage roads. Typical ETA is 30–60 minutes depending on segment and traffic.
