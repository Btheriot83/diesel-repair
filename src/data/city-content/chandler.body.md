Chandler freight flows on the Santan 202 with quick access to the 101 and I‑10. Long loop runs and heat accelerate wear on belts, hoses, and air systems, and Price Corridor traffic reveals small leaks fast. Our mobile techs arrive with scanners, air fittings, and common service parts to shorten downtime. We favor safe frontage pull‑offs and lighted lots when shoulders are narrow. Typical ETA is 30–60 minutes depending on segment and traffic.
