Tempe sits between major airport freight and east‑valley distribution, so the 101 and 202 carry dense, stop‑and‑go traffic. That idle‑creep pattern stresses cooling systems and exposes marginal batteries and alternators. We position techs near Rio Salado and Price Road to shorten response times, then perform mobile scans, cooling checks, belt and hose replacements, and light electrical repairs on site. Airport‑adjacent calls follow staging rules. Typical ETA is 30–60 minutes depending on segment and traffic.
